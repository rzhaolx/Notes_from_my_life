Welcome to the directory with my undergrad research pointers! The pdf file contains nearly all that I have to say about undergrad research. Take it for whatever it's worth!

I will also note that your research is YOUR journey, although I try to make generalized statements, it will be much more helpful to absorb what's in the pdf, and ask me with any individualized questions! I will be much more helpful knowing your exact interests and circumstances.

Best of luck, scientists!
